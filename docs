[" so KC what track are using look at the show note Marco I saw you using the show note there is a time and a place for me. It's okay see what OS using I will say that I did not downgrade and there were reason there reason most of them came from they think it wa a post-show conversation between the three of u where I wa convinced not to do it yet but but I don't want to talk about that yet so I wa going over to pick you up to you guy there a marker that he's going to hang out the above 77\u00b0 in his beach house I remember that I don't know that to you or is it over there I just jammed my mouse cursor into the lower left corner to try to get dashboard to come up with the weather wa it's 46\u00b0 but it's a hot room and have any that I see you right would start a we must do with some follow-up we had some really genuinely great feedback with regard to radar and feedback assistant and my particular feedback with regard to my Catalina Louis with go to", " in just a moment according to a couple of different people I believe feedback or feedback what's the plural of them those get turned into Radars internally so feedback assistant which is what the peon like the three of u would use to file a bug those are their own bucket of thing though those are the feedback and then internals Apple they get turned into Radars and so one of the other thing we asked about either on Twitter or perhaps here on the show wa I think one of you guy in fact bring up last week that you could do rdar colon slash slash and then radar number in that on an Apple phone to computer would give the person a hyperlink directly to radar to that direct ticket and according to famous people those link do still work but the feedback number is different from the radar number feedback generator when they're submitting to make it handled internally a the radar the feedback number is in a field of the radar so you can search for or tracking issue by feedback number or radar number but if you're linking to it with RDA are calling you", " have to use radar number and this one particular individual added I think the idea is that this let the radar just handled internally a a radar without worrying about confidential information getting fan transmitted back to the user I'm not sure about how or when thing get transmitted back to feedback assistant or the user the worst in the oldest and removed from the actual website go into another bucket to get speed by the real and then they don't even know if I do something in radar how how did that property back to the customer so disconnected it's like kind of like a soft are developer relationship with their customer in the App Store got a new phone call I know it's faster damn it it wa faster and faster wa obviously better who need to make phone call I know that during the main part of the show that I had said that one of you need to come to Richmond and kick me if I have not yet downgraded to Mojave we were discussing before the show possibly before we went live who it wa it wa going to come and kick me because I", " am still in Catalina but I have reason and I have update so I will leave it to the two of you to decide who's going to make the track down to Virginia and it sound like Well Done Right So speaking of that nature we did get an anonymous update on the radar that wa created from the feedback that I had created complaining and moaning and trying to get fix for my poor iMac Pro and so doe not miss person basically paraphrase now I'm now paraphrasing paraphrase what they had seen in the radar but if I understand what they said appropriately and I'm waiting for John to correct me after I make my little Spiel here it's that according to Apple hinchley thread contention on kernel task VM map lock to the point that the keyboard and mouse event can't get a lock on this like a global que I can pretty confident I butchered that pretty well John can you translate that into something that make more sense why is it so contentious first one second of all why doe Catalina handle a convention to worse then apparently and I have no answer but another", " thing that wa said in the radar according to the B is that a bunch of SMB Colonel work is to blame now I'm assuming u and be in this context is like song by Lake server server message block whatever it's called like Network share and I think that is because the Apple person that MDS and back up the and more importantly CrashPlan service and plaque were all between them spawning a zillion thread all doing stuff across the network using what I used to call Tom Beasley window Style Network shared my technology and apparently the Apple person called that crashed plane a being particularly egregious in this in this department in so who do you write such a it's so bad it's so bad that later if you let me but anyway it seems like that wa causing some real problem now I agree with you John I'm not entirely clear why this is worse in Catalina another thing that wa mentioned that I didn't copy of the note and I'm going right outside my head is that a core go up the amount of thing that could be asking for this Global La also go", " up so on an iMac Pro with that ha on his know how many course I have a billion that could actually exacerbated make thing even worse which is no bueno but the reason I didn't downgrade other than convincing from Marco and John that again I don't think made the release version the episode I decided to take a few different strategy now number one do the thing that everyone wanted me to do which I said I wa going to do and then did not do is try the other track that I have I had lamented mostly joking way that it wa all it wa all the way up in the attic I need to go get it blah blah blah so I went up to the attic and very moment I stop recording last week to get that all is to get that other trackpad that I lost my track that it came with the iMac Pro and it wa when I got the keyboard and and trackpad box back downstairs are back into the middle floor if you will that I open it up and realized oh wait I got a mouse with this I", " forgot like a traditional magic bounce I completely forgot right right I completely forgot I didn't order new traffic is why would I seem like it should I shouldn't need it so the reason I didn't try it wa because I didn't have an alternate one to try and I absolutely had planned on it wa going to try it however thing and let me do a little fully work and knock on my glass desk very loudly thing might be looking up I think so you're still using the old trackpad via Bluetooth I should a time using be able to write well almost the first thing terrible but I'm also Overjoyed that it seems to be getting better so the first thing I did wa I started turning off CrashPlan kind of strategically so when I wa really sitting down working on computer CrashPlan completely off and there's a launch control commanding front of the eternals turn it off now there are planted like be very gingerly with very soft hand when the user is at the computer but I don't trust their crap software for anything so I freaking turned it off and that helped some artlessness", " here's the thing the other two aren't listening right now I'm about to say something that the two of them are going to have a choice and they can either beat the crap out of me for the next 20 minute or they can be sympathetic and understanding so let's see what happens right so the other thing I did wa I took Plex off my computer which paint me why do we why don't we complain about that because this is my world my world is my medium consumption world is your world not running Plex on your ex running somewhere we well that's the thing no talk about that later but anyways it occurred to me that I had this Mac Mini that wa just kind of sitting there that I had gotten from Justin at stadium and it wa it sold remember exactly what vintage it is but it is more than enough to run Plex and it wa literally sitting there some sleeping and idle just because I wasn't doing anything with it I really wanted to have it in the house just in case you never really know why but I wasn't doing anything with", " it and it hardly wait a second why not run Plex on that and so I did that I took a while yet I've been literally removed it for my iMac Pro but I have not run it on my iMac Pro in about a week and I'm running it on the Mac Mini and the moment I made that decision everything started to feel better that in the combination of CrashPlan not running generally speaking seems to have almost completely fix my problem which is both wonderful and deeply depressed what is Plex doing spawn a bunch of thread-like plaque is one of the least demanding us of networking file resource you can imagine sequential reading work but it's not like it's like CrashPlan Moritz spawning a million thread and trying to read everything upon your positive it's alright well yes and I do have Plex can't my photo library but I don't think help cuz I don't think mine is a big a yours is no God I don't think my photo library is a big a yours but I I am still sure that that doesn't help much and also I do have a scanning like every", " 15 minute for New Media or whatever the case may day which is probably not necessary. What doe that do the crawl in your ear photo Library like periodically to see if there are new photo it is away from for the iMac Pro ha made such a big difference but it seems like it's made a tremendous friend is difference and so that ha worked really well down earlier today I turn CrashPlan on for the first time in a while and with a I don't know a couple minute of that happening I got a machine gun trackpad so I think the next step is morning to talk about this more later I think the next step is I'm going to move CrashPlan also on his Mac Mini although at that point I'm really tempting fate cuz that Mac Minis on Catalina and so maybe I'm just going to move the problem one computer to another who know use them that's really care a long a the thing is functioning it doesn't really matter so that is probably the medium-term plan the long-term plan which I'd like to get the rest fall out before we discus it with", " long-term plan is I'd really like to just divorce myself CrashPlan entirely and find a different mechanism to backup the Synology cuz that's really what I'm after it crashed plan after having reloaded to email both my laptop and desktop like forty four time in the last six month I've come to the point that almost everything that's actually on my computer is relatively ephemeral I'm sure there are thing that are not but the majority is on kid Hub it's it's on my Synology it's I don't know when iCloud or something like that so it seems like it shouldn't be a problem to adjust he'll get rid of cramp I did not have it backing up your iMac at all and I do if you have time machine if thing really get bad but it'll work space near the screw it I'll just reinstall everything on the computer from scratch so my question for later which I really don't want to get into now is how do I backup to Synology for le than $100 a month and I'm saying that only slightly facetiously but in summary the Mac Mini save my bacon I really appreciate that adjustment", " sent it my way and everything so far seems okay now remind me of that in like 20 minute when this thing failed miserably but sitting here now it all seems all right. Just that you're not removing temporarily troubleshoot you're moving in permanently it to another computer that you don't have to use that plexus the thing that is least ephemeral on my iMac Pro and reason I say that is because yes all the medium is stored on this analogy literally 100% of it but the database of what I've watched and where everything is and and all of this meditate and all that other garbage isn't stored on this melody that wa stored on my iMac and yes it is backing itself up to this analogy from time to time but it's just a nightmare she or he would have been a nightmare to move Plex to another machine out of like haste rank you don't even like when it wasn't on my own term and so I have it on this other computer unless the many blow itself up that is that leave me much more flexibility with the iMac to downgraded or to reinstall Catalina", " from scratch if I felt like it for some strange reason he'll now the the the iMac Pro is much more flexible than it wa before and so yes you're right it it's not a temporary thing with regard to Plex anyway but having Plex on it own basically dedicated device ha really freed up a lot of the stress in my world with regard to the iMac Pro one more thing about plex from troubleshooting with sleep-wake stuff slack is not great about this is a bug do they supposed to fix in the past but so I prayed about it able to grab power assertion that keep your know I keep your computer from going to sleep but even keep your screen from going into the screen saver or dimming or switching off which when you asked to play video then it just will not give them up a lot of the time you'll know you won't be actually playing any video because you had previously paid video if you look at the End by the downstairs the house and I'll see what is that light coming from that room with all the light are on I'll look", " in there and I'll see you know who is Plex so Plex if you're out there listening when you're not playing video of people if you have this happening to you so I just might be able to call for a job Powers auction anymore but still in mine but all right tell me John about the Pegasus J2 I please that's my $400 piece of bent metal that hold hard drive that I shoved into my computer had it on my desk for a while at a desk last week the weekend I got some time to go but I'm still terribly. I think this design of getting to the internals once you have the thing off because you have access and also I am bad at the beat it is harder it is a way harder than popping the side off of an old cheese grater it's hard to open the door rail cap plastic tower case physically physically difficult thing to do because there's a lot of friction plug the thing off and if you are not playing exactly straight Thomas Turtle little table that is lower than a desk but higher than the floor so there", " is a little bit of awkwardness that aside and my first problem wa that somehow I don't have a T8 Torx driver in the house I have 56 and I just I didn't have it yet so I had to go out and get another tool which is kind of annoying but beyond that insulation went fairly well my only real complaint they give you like a cable to connect to the Tower and the two saddle port on the motherboard power connector in the big side of cable to go to the actual drive and they make a single bundle of ribbon cable that you know supposed to fulfill that role and they taped it say like his bundle Venture into relieved with ribbon cable a tape them together right you think rate they know exactly what you mean. This is going in they know all the part are on the motherboard they know where the part are going to be in the hard drive this cable should be in exact fit but it is not is not an exact fit like for starter if you look at the part that plug into the drive and they are exactly", " level with each other like the drive are top and bottom they're not side-by-side you can't have these thing be exactly level going to be higher than the other one not going to reach the connector on the motherboard to solder connector in the power protector there in a line horizontally but the little the thing that plug in there are not three different like to go into thing that are three different distance they're all the same length untape some of the tape that they use to tape together this bundle of wire just try to get it to the thing with plug-in without taking too much I talked to Steve and he said yeah I did the same thing a you get what you pay for for only $400 for a bit piece of metal you know they can't bother making ribbon cable be the right like oh by the way but it did come with a terabyte hard drive so that's where some of the cause ain't hard drive retail value $134 over the hard drive in my computer at large another hard drive to tell the other day because I wanted one of the bigger than", " the other one have laying around so I'm doing that I don't like having a big noisy spinning hard drive inside my otherwise by computer so I keep it on method and spun down those two thing are not synonymous with this computer and Catalina perhaps surprisingly when I wake my computer from sleep the hard drive spin up even if it's not mounted and it stay even though it all you must love even though it continues to be not mounted it's an easy fix you can just mapped it and then I'm not it and then it's thing that I missed all this is I can definitely hear when the hard drive is corrupted hard drive head moving back and forth with the application called Mountain which I've had for age is the used to melt down Mountain I have one time for internal drive on my LG is greater and one of the feature that mountain ha something like a star but I bought it from the website because I think the deal with hard but I figure it is going to be some feature I can't handle my little demon that gas stove working so more", " money and potentially ha more feature there is a setting that are there many setting When I Wake from sleep and it's not Nelson spinet down there's a whole bunch of option about what do you do when you inject it what you should do when you wake from sleep and lung behold just put that setting now and I make that wake my computer up the hard drive spin up reminding me of my old 10-year old cheese grater making some noise of thing spring up back to blessed not quite silence so mostly thumb up on the expense paid is Pegasus J2 a big thumbs-up from Mountain although I don't like that menu bar icon could be better but anyway other than that I am headed

large Max light and you slack so I bet this is some of our listener out there so in the world Mac management the current accepted practice is to bind MDM and then use it to lock down everyone's device to use can only do quote safe thing and the result of this is it your user become frustrated they don't understand why you don't trust them they don't understand why the device feature and capability are turned off to really annoying do this often enough and they'll start just using their personal device to actually get their work done because they don't get in the way Collide is different Collide believe that end-user education about device security is the top", " priority so instead of locking down the device Collide allows you to monitor them continuously to see if they're compliant with your security policy and if any device isn't Collide can message that employee vyas and walk them through the policy why it's important and give them precise instruction on how to fix the issue with themselves and they can even message the user the instant they fix the problem so the user know they did it right and then you do all this by using an endpoint agent called OS query which is 100% open

collide for sponsoring our show how do you backup a small G in the reason I ask is we had talked just a little while ago about", " CrashPlan in the how I really don't like it but if there's a crash plan is that it is $10 a month for one computer for whatever plan I'm on right now $10 a month for me to backup I think my backup set of something like 13 terabyte right now now admitted lie that backup set includes the iMac Pro admittedly that backup includes a bunch of stuff on this analogy that I could probably pay her down and when when we doubt and so I looked before the show I wa doing a little preparation because I'm allowed because I'm not John and it turn out my medium folder on my Synology which is something I care most about early the thing I think I care most about is 8GB of the 13tb so I wa looking at you know what are my option for backing up the snow algae and the most obvious one the one that everyone recommends and for good reason because everything I've read is that it's excellent is backblaze B2 so this is dare yell bigger Longer term if I understand it right you storage that's really for this kind of a you", " so it's it's it's designed to compete with a bunch of stuff that are similar to put something away for a long time and probably not need to restore anything from it if ever or not enough frequently you know if you do it all nothing at it with me to it $70 a month for $0.13 a month it's $40 a month for a terabyte Miserables estimation but that mean it would take me like three and a half year of B2 to break even with your buying a whole new Synology filling it with drive and then moving this one's like my dad's house or something like that Which is far enough away that it is it's not anywhere close in Japan during the day the darn Synology from from here to there and this is kind of a call for recommendation from the from listener and from the two of you what what is what is one do with it like at the other thing I've heard decent about is Glacier a terrible thing I have is I want something else is close to turn key a possible and that be too very much count a because", " it'd be too it's built into the sonology software and I can just say hey please back yourself up did you now and if I'm willing to throw money at the problem which I'm heading over more willing to do then that that is an acceptable answer and in a very easy answer but what am I not considering what should I just Pony up literally $3,000 to me a bring a new version of my current Synology into my house and move this one to Dad's house where where is there something else I'm just not thinking of those long discussion I don't need all that Mission like this is the medium I think I care about the most but it's it's not really I know you spent a long time organizing everything and it's good to have a collection but you care so much more about your family at any of that meteorite set of that eat terabyte but yes what you just said is that le than one way to save money is to decide what part of it you really want it back so the most important thing is like your watch cancel your progress that", " is the stuff that you've invested time and dealing with the actual medium file behind the scene if they disappeared you can probably replace them right Minneapolis what subset of just by being judicious about which medium do I want a bag of odisha between you do I not want it back up and then Lord of all and if you're going to have somebody who's not you store 13 terabyte of data for you there's no way around that being expensive or hassle or both like there's no magic Solutions going to be like I have a way for you to do that for $0.03 or even $5 a month is not going to happen like you already doing that you're taking advantage of the best you can with the plan thing or if you would like I wa back play who you know that is the cheapest way to do it but both of those thing are assertive not using the service for their intended purpose and really pushing the limit so simpler solution answer but just to address a couple thing you said your point is overall very fair but the thing I just really I really", " don't want to lose any of this medium and I think the reason I'm I'm harping on this so much is because for the stuff that's on the Synology that is the only place it is but with these are some picture that is the only place that exists like all of my TV show and movie and thing like that at all or some of them actually I do have Blu-ray sitting downstairs but for the purpose of this discussion that's the only place that exists if they are in crash plan and so I'm so scared that if this technology just fry and I can't Salvage the drive for some crazy reason that all of that medium just go up and puffing the puff of smoke again the picture are different but beautiful like the medium file themselves once there they are don't change right so you can if you if you want to spend more penny Marco is making grunting noise about Glacier but there are various there are various temperature storage option in S3 let you hold a bunch of data that you don't need access to an is not going to change for le money", " than be to you maybe we have a look at the price going through the pain is about to get to get anything out of it is like pulling teeth and maybe that's acceptable if you really just like you know I got episode of super duper but that's no tearing down the dating of a cup is one way and then using slower storage with the knowledge that you don't need to access the difficulty is trying to use backup software lot of backup Suffern doesn't expect that scenario it expects to be able to sort of crawl your data and then confirm that it's backed up and dip the two thing and doing that wa going to be unfriendly probably because it doesn't expect that type of thing but we know that the nature of your back of his I'm going to back up these terabyte of data and they're never going to change in the back of their just going to sit there on modified 4 year in prison for being updated and so those can be fairly distant access TimeWise you just need to understand that but it doe not like I always do to pinch", " penny can I get to 50% like that's the best-case scenario and you still paying $30 a month so I agree and I promise to give you a chance I promise it but if I wa one of the backup strategy that I have is that a super duper clone of the iMac on a physical hard drive that you know one of those portable USB drive and a physical clone of my entire photo library on a separate physical hard drive in a USB drive that get the hand that yes I do my parent at least once a month usually twice a month that get handed to Mom and Dad at sometime after the beginning of the month and then they bring it back right around the end of the month I'll update both need to bring it back all you doing is adding to it like your own system two head and then it get stored and then you know I'm feeling my Synology I said it would only backup a half-step several of the drive I might Knology which are Western Digital whatever the masked Reds I think Western Digital red switch or whatever it came", " with literally six year ago almost 7:00 about half of the drive in there are the six year old drive and I have been replacing them bit by bit but it occurred to me that you know I am really playing with fire what have I think I have three 6 year old drive in there right now and I really really should try to get those you don't you're replacing a rather than later and a I'm replacing them you know I'm putting more pressure on every every drive that remains and so I'm really really really playing with fire but it occurred to me a I'm replacing them swapping from 3 terabyte 10 terabyte and I just told you my entire back upset is like NTB so presumably I could get one of these humongous one of these two and a half inch Drive side of matter one of these humongous physical platter drive 16tb drive now so you could add that to the physical package that I'm transferring back and forth dad you know an inn just give that to Mom and Dad once a month and have them bring it back and I do a quick", " update them send it back to their house and that's honestly that's probably going to be the best solution do with all this in mind tell me what I need to be doing cuz I have not hit the right answer. Okay so this all go back to the problem you have is that CrashPlan is the only online backup service that will backup unlimited space including Network share for a low price and most of your data life on a Synology so the only computer that you have where that data is local on local disc is this analogy I get around this with my stupid I said set up which I would not recommend anybody in a soon a any part of the brake are not replacing it but the real solution here is to take advantage of the other backup service that ha way better software is a frequent sponsor of our show and that will back up any drive connected to your computer locally which is backblaze and the way you switch to backblaze is by making this data local to a computer that run an OS that backblaze client over will run on you already", " have one we already mentioned it it's the Mac Mini that you just turned on so the way to fix this problem the simplest way possible is to buy a giant hard drive yes they come up to 16 terabyte now go by a giant hard drive or to connect them a local disc to the Mac Mini have the Mac Mini share them on the network itself if it want to and have a quiz back him up and then you don't have to do this craziness with your parent you have online backup you can even just you can even put two of them in the Raid 0 you have online backup Android last pretty long these day you could you could literally just due to external drive or one giant external drive plug into your Mac Mini at have backblaze back it up for the five buck or six buck a month it is that's it and that's the very end and you know it and I know that you no longer have a white BMW here I'm not going to tell you to give up Plex I'm not going to tell you to cut back your", " library but I will tell you retire this analogy at this point because it is old it is not providing you the computing power that you want for thing like black because he make it so hard and and it wa kind of a with me like right before they did a whole bunch of the transcoder acceleration stuff so like it's it's old it's full of by today's standard small hard drive it's probably can you a decent amount in just electricity every month just plug in an external hard drive to the Mac Mini because you have six wonderful year of incredible hard drive capacity expansion you can take advantage of now like the technology ha gotten better for Spinning Disk they're way bigger now and they're not that much money for very giant one so just do that and it's like I think that that right there is a solution to switch to local disk can I change the Mac Mini make that Mac Mini run all the software that your Synology wa previously running like you use the Matt Clines of these thing use Netflix use the Mac sharing stuff whatever it is like you know", " you might give up a few thing that your Synology wa doing that we're kind of cool that you know you occasionally used but overall I think this is a better solution and it is way simpler and while it requires a bit of investment up front first of all it's way cheaper than if you want to replace your Knology it's way cheaper if you need to replace a bunch of the drive in your Synology and it's probably cheaper. operate in a with electricity and it's definitely way better on the back of her because then you can simply use any Mac backup software so you can use that you can do what I do and use Ark which is fantastic and I actually I use ARC backing up to backblaze B2 storage I just kind of prefer the ark UI for certain thing but like you can do you have so many more option then because you're running what appears to backup software to be a regular consumer operating system on a regular pc / Mac you know but then you have option then and you have this one great option vs. backblaze unlimited and that I", " think solve your problem it's been a pretty simple elegant way and you can retire Synology allow these type of thing to go on Ice all recently a tweet where backblaze wa sad that someone wa using their service to backup many large number of terabyte to directly connect to their computer I don't know if it's meant to be a single computer thing if you're backing up 13th I know hard drive size are increasing but still it's kind of like an outlier so he may be running a few people eat that even then like the egg wa green. The solution is it right now you can do it right now it's a very simple and and simple in this case is a big benefit here like making this not a convoluted complicated fragile set up like just make it a very simple thing and you right now it work like in the future who know but right now it will work and in the future if you have to spend a bit more on backing up all your medium file oh well it's alright so of all those 8GB of prop with Hollywood movie and TV show", " mostly right so I evolve that what percentage of that can you just rear if if you lose it all and then whatever percentage of it that fell off truck sir wa not not available in the US or what do you know whatever the case may be like how hard would it be to either redownload it from somewhere or buy it all legally and what would that cost v what it will cost if you have to pay somebody per gigabyte to back u up for you in definitely like what are you paying overtime for that if you have to pay one of those $70 a month no fee what is that costing over time versus what is it what would it cost to actually ha replaced if you lost it. I'm so do that math if that come up but honestly you can avoid all that entirely right now I just plug in a giant hard drive to your Mac mini come back later I am not in a position that I'm willing to give up my beloved Synology and I agree with everything you said on paper but it also doe some thing that I", " know I could do on my Mac Mini but I'd like the way that's not what you were so I have a very good work left for it I don't want to mess with that but I take your point and I agree with you that getting one of these like 400 or 500 16 terabyte drive into physically hooking it up for the Mac Mini even if I just run like an arson anchor equivalent and pull everything off of the snow algae onto that drive and then back leg is now backing that up a a regular computer that is in the in Florida way I'm much better answer than anything else to come up with so far so I already like where this going to just leave it on and put it on the hard drive with your primary location move the 8 terabyte of Plex beta to the Mac Mini hard drive option and leave other stuff on this analogy we could be waist smaller off of your bike care about your rate on the phonology take photo on protection against Optive way to improve my world and I think Marco you hit it that the", " gift is getting a big friggin dress at least for now anyway certainly for now I mean if I got a 16 terabyte drive I am well over there well at least three terabyte of pepper and so a much a I am slowly filling up this this analogy overtime first of all there's certainly stuff I can get rid of in call absolutely without a shadow of a doubt and secondly you know that that that's plenty of extra space or plenty of Headroom that I wouldn't have to worry about it anytime soon and presumably there's no reason I couldn't just attach another one if necessary that's the giant metal box with multiple connector expensive for or power supply that doesn't spell garbage but like if you keep it relatively simple you can set you can buy a 12 or 16 TB Drive say this is the most I'm going to keep and when you need space on it you force yourself to go delete something that you not going to need any more that's another option that's honestly not a bad solution because you probably don't need to keep more than 16 terabyte of various medium file", " that are you no Moses Lake movie TV show like you probably can get rid of a lot of hat so maybe capping it at a certain size that is OneDrive which keep everything a lot simpler maybe that's it that's all for the best potentially of using back leg by backing up so much but it occurs to me than one of my additional hard drive arrived termite inside my Mac Pro so they can't really plan on using it the email that we will receive an to answer Jay stretch in the chat just off the top my head thing that I want to keep on my Synology I absolutely acknowledging believe that a lot if not all that could be on a Mac Mini I am not debating that I like it on this analogy I want to keep it on this analogy it make me happy BMS Knology never to post about this I'll look in the show not to talk about a lot of the stuff and thing like VPN server Docker container for homebridge obviously I can do that on the Mac Mini I like it on this Melody I like it over there", " off by it Lonesome the downloading torrent if I ever do that or stuff from these group if I would ever do that wa obviously I wouldn't know my Dropbox replacement is the biggest one of all because for those who have been keeping up I am almost entirely off of Dropbox and I used to Knology drive a a replacement I'm sure there's something I can put on the Mac Mini on the mack many that would be an equivalent but again I'm not looking to disrupt my entire world I am looking to disrupt my backup strategy and I think Marco if it's if it's that I just internet a 16 terabyte hard drive to my dad if it's that like even if I did that which I agree with you is not the best answer my point is that that's still a much better answer than paying $500 a year to backblaze B2 or later the better answer for me but again I couldn't agree more that I think the bestest answer is to just stick a big fat hard drive on the Mac Mini and I just kind of like having this knowledge e being the", " one source of Truth for my data that just make me happy that I know it's all right there it make me happy and sin no small reason because if God forbid the house one on fire I would know just grab the Synology Advocate grab the Synology and it ha all the stuff I need which is silly I know it's a lot smaller a single mid-tower computer I'm with you but I like having this knowledge you be the center of my storage World it make be happy it doesn't have to make sense either with her or you mark Worman it just it make me happy and that's why I would like to keep it but be at a speaker not be at just connecting it to the Mac Mini which again I think it's the best answer one way or another to putting a big fat hard drive somewhere in duplicating on my date on it that's the difference between what I'm saying what you're saying I would want that to be a redundant copy of all this data you're saying doe make it the canonical data and I can't make it the primary stop early", " right yeah you're probably right and on paper I think you are right and if I wa a scene individual I would get what you're saying but because I'm just weird like this I think I would have that is redundant copy and then yeah that got sent up to the cloud that's the best of all answer if for some reason I don't do that or that doesn't work if I don't know why it wouldn't then I could sneakernet it to Dad and still an improvement over the world I have today where I'm relying on crash plan which I freaking hate so I am glad I hope this isn't a waste of time for everyone else listening but I'm glad we talked about it cuz this this is a much better plan of action than I had before and just reiterate if I were to sonology I would want to take the one I have and stick it at dad and so I can't take the driver out of this one and put it in the new one cuz I would want again I would want a redundant Synology and to do that the way I want", " to see what you can this is all my own choice he's over $3,000 that is a lot more money than $500 or $600 so I think Marco you hit the nail on the head over time the threshold for like do you need a giant Nest box go up with like in a how high your story are like overtime that are so it go up because hard drive get bigger and you would never recommend in 2020 that somebody who need to store for terabyte of data get an S because hard drive are ssds can store that locally really easily and so they were just going to be a few terabyte there is no need to have a giant Dino Drive enclosure in a whole second thing to maintain an update and everything else and I think for you when you first got this analogy you were within the range of like okay you have enough data is reasonable to to need like a big multi-drive thing but since then the driver gotten so big and the back of situation ha become more important now I think you're at the point now where if you were starting", " from scratch today we would never say you should get an as because while there are people who still need nest box because they have massive storage need your storage need to qualify you are no longer one of those people and that doesn't like I don't think almost anybody should go back to playing the time for them is most behind u and and most people don't need them and I think the number of people who need them is going down over time because he ha this incredible tolerance for a terrible noise very close to him but to me the biggest advantage of an as is it's in the basement I don't hear it and if I had 30 in terabyte of medium like that I wa just talking about it keep my hard drive spun down inside I can have sex but the storage that is not on an SSD I do not want I want them not spinning an unmounted and you can't do that if you actually like at my photo collection wa on spinning medium my photo are on my SSD that have to deal with that but if you have $13 by", " today to give me. Online all the time you better be ready to deal with the sound of spin disc fairly close or I love my Synology so darn much I love it it's it's the sort of thing I would have never spent the money on at the time and now that it's part of my world I cannot like today anyway I can't get rid of it and I'm not arguing with you Marco you are so right and so many way but it just it is it is become the center of my Computing world and I like it there because it make me happy and it is not knock on glass ha never failed me it is it is always worked it is never cause me problem more if it's done better than my iMac Pro ha and it and I've had this knowledge for 6 year by the iMac Pro for 6 week but nevertheless your point is again but you did is certainly very fair is not correct that for a normal person this is not necessary but it's there are many like it but this one is mine that's reference.

I think is going to happen and talk about this for the entire under the radar", " for sale that is certainly worth listening to if you want to hear stock for almost 30 minute about this topic and kind of you know what it mean and kind of instead hi I think there is a DD chance of Apple Holdings conference are extremely low because you know this is a significant virus that's going around the world it is it is causing death and it's not like it's not killing everybody who get it but it is a serious problem and it's not something that can be taken lightly it's me that everybody's be very cautious about and apple juice company and apple is a company that try to avoid bad press whenever possible and no company want to put on an event that you know at the event expose people to this virus and one of them dy like that's horrible nobody want to risk that understandably and so there is there is no way that I think I wa going to put this conference on I think they are way too smart to do that anybody who's running for a high-profile thing like if they're not canceled because it's a big enough problem like", " the desire of the pretty big problem the effect are still largely unknown the gestation period is long and so you don't really realize how bad it is for a couple of week after it ha gotten that bad and these are all event that have to be planned month ahead of time that are you know that they were gathering the whole of people from all over the world and in like confined space and it's another they're still there some conference that are happening in the near future that are that are still going to go on allegedly but I think that's a mistake for those conference and I think they're hearing from it like in a major sponsor and participant are pulling out of conference company are restricting their employee travel they're saying with it that they're not allowing employee to travel to conference anymore for a lot of love it's a big deal that wa not going to take any risk apple not stupid there there are conservative smartcompany there there's no way this conference go on John what do you think you know I haven't heard the end of the option you can do that", " ha been streaming live on the room maybe the 7-second delay or something they can do the same way they do all the other pressing like you know it's hard to me is at the very very Apple ha also find some way to charge Koda court at 10 to use $1,600 to attended online but I'm like already if you pay nothing you can stream the session live for free what would you be getting with a man would they mail you a jacket and some pant I don't think the ticket price come close to paying for like the massive cost that Apple indoors for this conference like we pay for the venue and your box lunch the most expensive part of this conference every year is probably the massive amount of time it take to prepare for all the employee all the engineer that have to go there and prepare conversate or prepare presentation and be there for the lab that's a massive amount of Labor that go into that that is probably way more expensive to Apples and the actual nut and bolt of like the copper Center cost a much a conference I think what", " they are what they are most likely to do is to just do a bunch of online session just like they've been doing a you said like they've they've been live streaming I think they're just going to release extension video and have a small medium event where they live, keynote and I think it's going to be at now I would like to see them do more I would love to see them invest more heavily in thing like documentation sample code and possibly this is a bit of a reach but possibly staph DDS and expand some kind of form of the lab to be online in public where you get to actually like talk to Apple Engineers about specific question and problem you have with specific apis and your code and they'll look at it in the lake in a DTS incident do when you have a developer account but free and easier like that kind of thing dts famously a very very very very very small staff and I would love to sit and stand up I would love to see them take the resource they are saving by presumably not having this conference and use", " that to really beef up the documentation and really beef up the sample code and the end and really beef up DTS and then just give more developer more accept the stuff without having them fly across the world to stay in a very expensive hotel and and you know this one thing in person for these few day a year because if you think about it like that whole system is incredibly inefficient and Incredibly exclusionary like it it's very exclusive like the percentage of Apple developer that can actually go to the conference is such a tiny percentage of all the Apple developer out there on the world it's this a few thousand people out of hundred of thousand or million of iOS developer around the world like we're talking a lot of people here it's a very big field and so anything they can do to make that more accessible to more people ha way more value than any make a possible change about the, to self like Devil we know how it is for local ten day and you know I let the conference I've been fortunate enough to be able to go to every one", " of them since 2009 and I know I consider that a privilege and yet I also look at it a in every year I kind of think this is this is kind of wasteful this is very expensive Cy stock earning badge a couple year ago to it's like you know cuz I'm going mostly for at the community event send an occasional like he's not like find a way to sneak into a lab and a person but otherwise I can mostly going for the butt but like we would have so much more value to more people if they beefed up all of the online resource and if they're not going to have a conference this year I think that is a good like it if you can find a silver lining and then canceling this conference that's it like they should redirect that energy and that time to making thing that everybody can use making all that stuff better the documentation is in a terrible State sample code is it ha been decimated by all those change and Swift like most sample code doesn't work anymore like it's just really need they need a lot of help", " and documentation and and all that supporting stuff and they it's just need help and I hope that it get it that being said I don't think most of that is likely to happen I think what's most likely to happen is the comic ha canceled and we just give it a chance at that smoke when I think about the video like the cost of putting the cost of the engineering they take out to prepare and perform the presentation in that time doesn't probably shrink at all for them doing it you know how to Stage vs. not if anything maybe they have to do more take in front of it, right cuz I still have to prepare the presentation to tell to make sure they have slide and Sample code in a rehearse presentation that ha correct you know every all they are. In this correct all the information is correct and it match up with the WWE belt that engineering time is absorbed where there where there are not all the people who time get back or the people who play in the Advent deal with the venue deal with meal deal with security those people", " to do anything like they're free. But they're not going to send me hop on to make me documentation better so it is still a fairly large cost Apple engineering or you don't have to be in this building for a couple of day or the entire week you know you don't have to actually physically be there once you're done with your video you can resume your regular work and then the video is go out to the world right and then a well like a lab in her mobile apps I think it wa making me when you were saying that is made me think about do you remember when I chat video conferencing first came out one of the feature that had is you could sort of share a document like you could see the little face on the screen the metal 3D kind of you and then you can also share document on your two little face would be looking at the document driver that know it wa so bad multi-person conversing right in the way they did it wa instead of just seeing instead of in the window just seeing like the other person right", " you would see the other person would become like a little little pile that we could have moved back into the screen kind of like a bunch of picture frame sitting on a table or whatever and then when you shared document that the document will be another little picture in the in the service setting or cover flood table setting I'm at the point is it would let two people would like to see the other person's face and a document that they can also see on their screen and I can't tell you how many time I'm usually doing stuff with my parent on FaceTime or whatever and we essentially want to share a document let's all look at their whatever thing together like in this context not I'm going to open up another window and I look at this document and you look tattoo on what like so we can both be looking at it together and I would like Google Docs whatever you enter actually see each other's cursor in both feeling the same document a rebel just it's so much easier if you can just say here in this multi-person FaceTime chat with the whole", " family let's look at this thing or let's look at a bunch of picture together I have a slideshow to study let's go through it all and look at all the picture you can see the picture on the people's reaction to them something like that would go a long way towards making thing like Labs possible interactively over some Apple product are communication protocol the Apple feel insecure and you're all happy with their whatever let's all be assertive collaboratively working on a thing something better than going to let Apple control my screen the screen sharing or overlap with you my old desktop with screen sharing just a selectively share document or a single window or to be an apple turn brown upon people telecommuting they like thing to be in person they don't have a lot of collaborative tool to be able to have a bunch of people working on something together a a terrible a thing like WebEx and zoom in Microsoft team and slack and wa all thing are almost all those tool have is table Stakes a bunch of people can communicate through audio video and also can all be looking at a single", " document their screen the same time I didn't do anything remotely like Labs remote you know when people are in person you need something like that an Apple ha nothing like that I can't really imagine Apple instructed everyone to download Zoom WebEx so remote Labs unless it's all going to be over like I do if my parent are just Raw on FaceTime and then I like hold up like a phone or a laptop screen front of the camera and I don't see that working where the punch Dover the same everything work out so once there's no longer conference suddenly Engineers will have a bunch of time to show up there. Could be the one of the announcement in wwc is this week and that's like revealing work that they had done over 6 month or a year that if that's what they had done that happens whether or not they had wwc2 nevermind do is bring up Engineers time a do with the thing they are in the past but I'm hoping that's the case of loving you reveal is we made a big effort to improve this aspect of the developer experience and we are", " reviewing it at wwcc not doing it while you're watching a bunch of video I wouldn't hold my breath on that they don't really like that if they know it's the thing that people want their want to have heard your complaint about documentation and we've improve documentation XYZ way whether or not is it a significant Improvement or the you know make it sound better than it is very often there's some effort to help with that you know it don't come out and say it that way and I think that might happen very often there's something big and shiny did they can throw out and everybody from any issue anymore Jason sample code what should I say in arm transition team asking if this wa the year for the arm transition that would be I would be brutal you know fer for the three of u yeah this is our job but well I think especially for me and Fargo maybe for John it's our job to go to the conference or at least to go to the event I should try and be there for it and make an appearance and let me know I think", " this time. Is kind of a responsibility for the three of u had a lot of show there when it happens but but it is extremely expensive Natalie's the ticket $1,600 but any even slightly reasonable hotel is easily another $1,600 if not two thousand plus dollar and I will never forget I don't remember who said it to me but I will never forget when it started to get really and truly expensive when it wa still in San Francisco proper somebody looked at me and I wa the year that the Apple watch have just been released or an ounce or whatever I believe this is underscore reset it what's an underscore underscore looked at me and said you realize that this $400 a night hotel is you buying an Apple watch every single night and then throwing it away in my mind exploded and I just couldn't believe it I wa a god that is preposterous that is utterly preposterous I mean I could go on a 3-hour to hear about how not to say expensive everything them in the valley is and I don't understand how anyone can afford to live there but be that a", " it may go to this conference a someone who lived in the United States you're probably going to need to get on a plane so that's between five hundred thousand buck in most case your if you want to take it to the event that's 1600 hour to call that an even mm then you want to sleep somewhere and preferably somewhere that like ha you know all the wall this floor in the ceiling so that's probably another $2,000 you looking at $4,000 you haven't eaten anything you haven't drank anything I may be talkin booze just in general I haven't ate or drank anything you do get those sweet sweet sweet box lunch for quote unquote free breakfast. I guess you could have their crap circular Bagel like thing at the at the conference at dinner I mean you looking at between 2 to 4000 and $5,000 for a week and it's just it's just banana that it's that expensive and you know somebody in the car singing lesson for hotel cost cold is the night to get a really decent room where I am and he's always nice hotel 400 or more it's it's just it's Preposterous", " and so a we've said you know I love WTC I really do I love the event like the conference I love I love the actual conference that take place in convention center I love love love love love all the the Superfluous and other thing that happened around it when I had the chance to go to layer I love that there's so much good to be said about this but I also feel like we have been there's been some pension building over the last several year a thing are just getting insurmountably expense and to the point that the only people who can afford it are people who are building their employer and maybe that's okay with that but I don't know but for someone like the three of u top it's hard it's frustrating and so I would love to see it what doe I would hate to see it go away on a more permanent basis although it seems like we all agree that maybe this year should I would love to see a lot of thing change and I'm really looking forward to listening to that under-the-radar to here with you and David had", " to say about it and making it at that this is kind of ridiculous now if you look at the landscape of tech conference a a hole there wa there wa a. Kind of a golden era of tech conference that were mostly smaller conference started about 10 year ago and ran until probably about three or four year ago and this wa an error when they were lot of conference big and small at all different price point all around the world and they would never do pretty well like you know it wa always a lot of work and put them on a few of our friend put them on and it wa kind of throwing a wedding but every year it wa it wa it wa a fun look immunity it wa a fun thing to do for the group of people who wa lucky enough to be able to do it basically I'm in travel over the world and go to the go to use fun thing are hope that when wa camp near you and that made thing a lot more sensible than moriam locality but something changed a few year ago and it started", " to become increasingly difficult to sell conference ticket it's hard to become increasingly difficult to run a conference and break even and not sleep on your mind into it like a way to make money and so it's even worse than writing book and so it's it became a kind of the market for conference seem to really crumble apart a few year ago and most of the conference's that were going strong five year ago are gone now and they're they're very few a soon a we left and I wonder if my theory is a time for the most part ha been like it used to be that you could get somebody like John Gruber to to speak at a conference and that would sell ticket that you that you could go and if you wanted to hear Drunk ever talk about something you could go to the conference pay the payment of this take a fee is and travel there and you could see people that you liked online you can see them talk and it wa interesting and you could like meet them afterwards maybe you're hanging out or had this little community of other people", " who were there and hang out with them and that wa great for a while and then everybody got a podcast or everybody got it and then everybody got a YouTube channel and no you can hear the people who you're interested in you can hear their thought for free all the time in podcast store on YouTube channel and you no longer need to go to conference to hear what these people sound like in real life or to see like what you know to kind of get an idea of their personality Beyond like if they're worth they write on a site somewhere you can actually just listen to podcast YouTube channel for free and everybody can do it and preparing conference talk a the presenter that format ha a certain expectation of like formality and preparation that make it a very time-intensive thing to make it it's a parent conference talk is in is a ton of work making good slide rehearsing the talk making a having a giving it like a nice story arc and everything it's a it's a ton of work for a presenter and you do all that work and all you got", " it is the end maybe a hundred people are a couple hundred people see it maybe if you're lucky to live on for a while you know outside of the conference but you use that didn't happen usually you know you're giving it to the room and that's it or you can do a podcast or YouTube video which is usually unscripted or le scripted there's not the big citation of like the four Molech slide and nicely designed everything you have the opportunity to edit work to Output format than a conference talk all of u like who used to go to conference and speak we now do other thing because frankly it's le work and we reach way more people with way le effort and see you have that side of the market that on the other side you have people just not seeing the need to pay hundred or thousand usually of dollar to go to conference to see people when they can listen to podcast and so I think the market for for conference in general ha mostly evaporated for for that kind of like in a community small kind of thing what's left are these", " like Mega conference that usually like the platform owner Run for the people on their platform so you know thing like WTF Google IO mention by,, that's a separate thing I'm not in that world I don't know about that world but not like conference of like it's like instructional talk to people or you know here's my origin story that kind of look at that supposed to talk about the market for that is really hard now it like the small conference are mostly gone you're most looking at just a big platform Better Than People go to these thing like basically just to hear about the new apis and go to the lab in and try to get time with developer so the more of that I think that we can remove the need for the better everybody will be because the way that the small conference ha died ha resulted in way more availability of these people's wonderful content available to everyone all around the world anytime for free so how much can we do to make WBC in Commerce is like it more like that how much can we do to reduce the need for these", " to make their value available to more people all the time everywhere for free that the kind of government they were talking about it definitely is undercut by podcast but there is another kind of conference that life on and in fact ha blossomed in the in the the shadow of the other kind of conference Sephora for good and Pharrell and that's the more instructive sort of like classroom type of thing where it's like a little miniature school so it's it's you can't replace it with like a one-way communication because it's interactive like a classroom where it is a room full of student and a teacher when you get to ask question and stuff in that doesn't happen in a podcast or YouTube setting it educationally focus so people and door company are willing to pay for it a a form of training these one tend to be there also the big one but by the time we spent the last destruction of the small one can get away with being more instructional it's because we're not a platform owner in fact our business is teaching you how to use their technology and more product here so", " that you can be you know trained up and get these heel either get a job or improve at your current job and Company will pay for you to go to this type of training I'm there a couple of big medium chosen this area like event apart an event apart for web Technologies which is a long-standing conference being like a little thing where is just what form is it is summer will come into your company and teach a bunch of people of thing but there are one you go to Vendetta particular location to learn about stuff there are some scammy one that are you know come to this 10 day bootcamp then what turn you into or whatever and you pay all this money and it's like I could have just learned this online but I feel like that type of that interactive nature lends itself to an in-person room full of people at the where did the mass start to make sense of like a why would I why would I spend all this time on this polishing his message to tell a true reminder people but you wouldn't have that same question about why", " would a room of 50 people and wanted to teacher spend their time narrowcasting to each other that well it's interactive classroom you don't want a million people in a classroom million people in fashion can learn that what you need some sort of give and take some sort of question answer you know why you no education tends to work that way and is not turned over entirely too just one way blast of a YouTube channel that teach you math or something what doe a place for that a well so I think that type of conference is more durable and maybe ha a better business model because you feel like you're getting value out of it and certainly the business model of people paying money for education is well established so I'm thinking that that's going to be hard to go away but you read the consolidation the other kind of conference ha not left a lot of room for the small thing that you're describing and then if you think about what's left AWS reinvent where the hell that thing is called I think I still doing the giant Oracle thing a a giant Salesforce conference", " WWDC doll the big giant platform owner them and the networking the sort of in-person networking is still definitely real thing I think that same that we're going to happen to those educational thing a well but certainly have is much more at let's say the Salesforce conference or whatever that is my line and I'm saying this is a someone who doesn't like to add an introvert you can do a surprising amount of networking online but I think a we all know like it's easy to say these in person conference in her place by podcast after we have all gone through a phase where we went to lunch and then the met a bunch of people who are now our friend like that type of impression networking is really valuable and just because we've established a friend group in our industry already doesn't mean that now we no longer need this conference is because we don't need them there for nobody's first time WWE attendee Come Away with connection that are super important for the future of their career and it'll be a shame in particular in the Apple Community to lose that because without an interesting", " to see how did I meet you in person would we ever have met if if wac didn't exist then we weren't there in person for a long time before that but we had never interacted until we had occasion to be in the same place at the same time it's the way that work out in some way I mean we have the problem with scaly and that's great when apple a small a company that made sense but you're totally true there are so many developer to be fraction of them to get the WWE just keep going down and down and so you know that they're still be true but their opportunity is so slim because they heard you know they have been for a lottery to get a ticket for cry about it used to be that Apple would call you and say hey you know you have a free WWE C2C Premier member do you want to use that he will go like apple with nag you just to try to cajole you into using your free ticket a part of your and you know thousand something dollar time have changed there is a lot", " of Demands there is very little Supply but I still think for Developers for new developer developer new to the applicant that in person contact with it with the group of other Apple developer is actually really valuable it would actually be great if they can expand that read the contract and you probably talk about this another Apple would come to your city with a smaller crew and do a bunch of presentation to a limited subset before I ever went to WTC I went to the Boston area text talk thing and didn't meet anybody anybody because I don't like people that they were there I could I could have talked to Paul cabasa this but I didn't you were near a people I wa I wa near them so that type of thing may be providing a place where people can actually meet each other physically doe still serve a purpose I think so I spent a large part of my my coming-of-age year on the internet on discussion forum old like all them and I became clear to me overtime that form have a certain ideal size and it if you are below that size it's", " just kind of to low traffic and it's it doe not much reason for anybody to go like check it regularly cuz there's not enough new stuff and then because you can you can visit the form throughout the day and see new stuff and people can play off each other and get response really fast and it's really nice but if it grows too large is also an upper bound Beyond which it's just too much and it's actually doesn't function very well a a community anymore doesn't feel very Community like them Community mechanic start to break down if he come like you know just more hectic and too much volume and the the entire for mechanic just ha this like higher because upper bambridge kind of fall apart isn't very good anymore conference have that too and their conference like suck I have like 50 people is it a 5,000 people and 50 50 50 people one were bad in fact they were some of the some of the best I think the value of networking and a meeting people at a conference go down a a number of attendee go up because it's it becomes harder", " for people who don't already have their friend group to actually find and meet the people they want to meet or two to find a meat or even just like my other people who even if they weren't like you know people they knew before like the percent a the number of conference attendee go up and especially a you don't get a many like repeat visitor every year cuz of the number of people trying to so high I'd like they try to get a lot of first-time ticket so like that it's hard to get a ticket multiple year in a row so the odds of what building of community networking is Meaningful over in over a year to whatever else I still think it's harder a a comment get bigger and I think WWDC these last few year ha crossed that threshold where is actually pretty difficult to network with people because it's there it's almost there there's just too many people there it's like a little bit too big and I don't think the move to San Jose ha actually help that much but I don't know if it's really hurt it but it just it", " seems like the conference is so big now that even that aspect that supposed to be really good at conference is harder now it's it's harder to get value out of that see I disagree with you slightly I think networking is just a good if not better because you're getting a new batch of people Mount you largely new batch of people every year but the thing that I struggle with in the thing that wa so great about early WBC so I started going in 2011 the thing it wa so great about that is it now in 2011 I met you and maybe 5 or 10 people that are really hit it off with John included and then in 2012 in another couple people and over the year I've been more more people and it made more lasting relationship and that I think you're absolutely right it is harder to to to build a lasting and meaningful relationship across several wtc's because they it's unlikely that you yourself will go to stop on the road like you said and be even if you dedicate yourself to going maybe they are going to layer if not the Big", " Show or maybe just hanging out then the Joe Smith or or or Mary Smith or whomever that you met last year maybe they didn't make it this year and that make that sort of thing differently but if you want to meet a whole bunch of people at random place you own the traditional business easy way of networking I don't think that's really any worse but I do I do find for me it's it's very hard to effectively and appropriately manage my time because this is inside baseball me to this is first world problem and if it's really terrible Marco just cut it right but for me it's very hard because I want to spend time with you and John for example in my key on my co-host across my show I want spend a lot of time with you guy cuz I don't get to spend time with you guy in person really ever except in G+ want to spend time with people that I don't see often and so like you're on the occasion of the jelly is in town and he's coming from the future he's coming from Australia so it is not", " easy to get him and I on the same spot I want to spend time with you but then at the same time I want to spend time with apple Engineers that I'm friendly with sometimes just a friendly with that I don't get to see very often so we make time for them and then while I'm there I also want to make time for people I don't know the available for four people who are stranger to me but but maybe I've been in their ear for the last five year and I want to make time for them and see what end up happening is for me I'm always saying to somebody all I can meet with you for 20 minute or so yeah I'd love to hang out but I got to go or I didn't realize what time wa I am sorry we're in the middle of a very deep and important conversation I really got to go and that sort of thing is also become very hard I think a lot of that is because I have come to know a bunch of people over the year but I don't think you need to", " be a podcast I think it's just you need to have been gone several year in a row and it's just a really tough and and I would like to see a change but darned if I know what to recommend and you know I don't know how to add a backseat drive this conference call Tiffany small like she hasn't like it's gotten bigger and that more people want to go which mean there's more turn over from year to year but like you're really quite like even if you don't see any of the same people Allison you may be your first or your second particular group of people become a lot of first-timer second time attendee certain people you meet there still no and our friend with and it's not because you saw them again the second year old that help or whatever but but for 5,000 is people and by the way when you said early WWE season record 2011 I'm sure lot of people were another reason that he's going to be a big change for a long time since the 80 90 I have a VHS tape and most of these big conference popular", " Converse ha 10 time a many people a WWDC and I think if you would ask somebody at the 60,000 person Salesforce conference do you find it difficult to network because there are 60,000 people I think I'm in Granite the different group of people they're going to say no it's great ton of people I meet love meeting the people and doing all the networking and so on and so forth like smaller conference are more intimate and you able to connect you no more reliable fashion with a small group of people with le effort but I don't think 5000 is too big and even though the demand is so great that there's turn over I think it's still a man that you have to look at it from the eye of a first-time attendee like not from a multi-year attendee who ha a bunch of people they know in whose time is in such demand like to know bar are case of whatever like it's just if you are if your baby first or second one or two other people doing that just once can be incredibly valuable to just get you started on your career is", " why I'm not saying that I think he's that WC need to continue is out of the way it is but I think there need to be some kind of if you shave like to go Riteway without any kind of replacement and I'm not sure what what could possibly replace it but I think it it's been valuable in my career in life and I hear from people who have attended to the first or second or third time that they also find it valuable even people who say I don't go anymore but I'm so glad I went that one or two time because it really you know set me on my path a much a I don't like going out into the world being face-to-face with people is extremely valuable again would we be doing this podcast had we not met face-to-face despite the fact that we didn't you know at least a mark on me and I knew it wa him online but it never let u to start a podcast together right nobody knew Casey so all catalyst and it's very difficult for me to say but we don't need that anymore because it's too", " big and it doesn't work like there are limit but I feel like he is what are the thing Apple's WWDC is tried to keep it from getting baked a if they wanted to make that are easy and 50000 person conference they could probably do it but they haven't and they don't and 5,000 maybe a little bit crowded but I still feel like it's it's tenable I see the people who are there and do you know where the first time people hanging out and maybe they're starving a group with the people from the company that I talked to some other group like I think it still work about tiger I can agree with him or it is been such a valuable a portion of my life and career that I would I would hate to have somebody else missed out on

the subset of thing that each person us right like the thing that you use everyday that you think everybody know about the new somebody else using a Mac and they're using none of your thing but they

can't get back to easily get back to where it wa like it's like it's a flower or something you want to like put it back exactly where it wa but if you don't find exactly where and you release like it'll land on your desktop or something you don't want to move to your desktop the finder ha undo and also thing but anyway trying to find a safe place to let go of the thing the dragon can be so much for all this happens on released that performs an action but there's no safe area in the screen for me to release and say but just don't do what I wa doing just abort abort well on the", " Mac if you hit the Escape key while you were dragging Siri and a well-behaved Mac application if you're still dragging you're still holding down the button hit escaped and never mind you doing I'm going to stop

you find Erwin you and it's filled with a bunch of folder some of which are disclosed somewhere Sorrentino like it's just it's just a giant or something into that folder but anytime you drag it over the window it start like highlighting one of the folder you like no I don't I don't want to be one of the folder inside this folder I wanted to be a sibling called do I get", " this thing that I'm dragging you into this list you find her window but Justin in the folder that went to represents not every single Pixel that I can drag it over with have it ending up inside some other folder that ha disclosed not disclosed if you drag the item onto the column heading like name date modified or whatever again in well-behaved variance of the finder and well-behaved use in situation that ha historically been a way to drag something safely like a safe drop region I see you want this to be in this folder and you're not hovering over one of the other folder that are in it but you are within the realm of the window so just drag it onto like the name Colin or whatever in the window what's the good one I can think of a bunch of stuff with the option key that I do without thinking about it and switch class and print center have all these you know if you go to the website so you can see all the different combination this is very difficult to convey I don't have like an overlay that tell you about them", " but basically there's ton of modifier key that you can hit thing at ardene EOS so for example if you hold down the option key and click on a window blowing into another application it will hide the previous window or application behind you like a you leave the thing you just left oldest bullhide in the thing you're going to will appear That's you know you can do two thing in one motion that way I can combine with my application you know that's extremely handy there's all the keyboard command for doing window hiding showing in the window menu if you look at the Wyndham in your most application behave like hide and hide others command and option H very handy again if you don't know those command exist to come sometimes you frustrate me to have so many different window but there are command you can type to make Windows appear and disappear don't really blew my mind that that hearing you talk about finder made me think of what is the icon at the top of a window wa at the

generic and everyone ha it you know I'm looking at a folder and it happens to be called development and so at the top of the finder window there's a little blue folder next or Thursday or development if you click and hold and then eventually dragged that folder you are clicking holding in dragging that. open folder whatever happened to be called so you can do thing with it like Marco said you know that's also true of like a Word document or Pages document in a whole bunch of other thing and that I forget that it exists a lot of the time but every time I remember it end up saved my bacon or making something a lot easier than I then it would have been otherwise I saw some guy said before being shocked click on the title of a finder window y'all are people born knowing that answer is no

Down and just read it because you'll probably learn something John Mitchell right difference between using a Mac apps open whatever at logon setting and it preference versus adding it to system preference user and group login item I feel like I'm fighting against the tide", " by wanting them all in one place preferably in login item I I would assume that the open apps on open at login setting doe not necessarily need to go login item but I don't know any specific difference here so perhaps one of you guy do maybe John both of my application I wanted to have that little check box again or whatever it is they're both the kind of application where the feud want to do that and everyone ha login item when everyone whatever lot of people know login item if you go to system preference in the user and group in their list of thing that are going to lunch when you login into it but sometime couple year ago you start to see application application they would have preference set launch and login is that not showing up there it doe 1 ton log in the check box work but I don't see them when it came time for me to add lunch and log into my pant again and you find a bunch of older answer it's like so many thing having to do with the reason this change is good old Santa boxing", " and boxing world all these random Mac application can access this playlist that is not in their container the login item feel it doesn't belong to anyone application Mission data you do you have to throw up a Russian dialogue at full disk access sandboxing make much more difficult so to get around that Apple came up with a new way for you to make your application long time but it's not a simple a like I'll just cause a pee on my Apple device unlock in the API that you call the app that you're calling it from you cannot call that API to make the app that you're calling it from launch on login you can only call that API to make some other app sure there's some guy I'm sure there's some kind of security reason to dislike I don't honestly I don't understand it you have to make another Target in your application that will be a launcher application whose sole job is to launch your actual application if you look inside front center are you looking tight which class you will find a timer application inside both of them called trendsetter launcher or switch class", " launcher and the only thing in the code of that application code that will launch the real application so you actually made for apps application application application then I relapse addiction kill launcher feature right doe why doe it matter to call whatever you had a lunch on login it's like I have to make an embedded Target what and then how do I make sure the sign work and then you know the deployment Target for my embedded launcher wa different from my application minimum version ha like 10-12 So Undercover on 12 but the launcher can only run 10:15 so anytime anyone earlier than 10:15 did the launch of wood would start to run Ruby like a version of the OS ha all this is the current system is bad having everybody group edit a random shape is also bad I just hope they come up with a better system that you know what you want is you want to be secure and whatever need to be secure you don't want to have to write an embedded launcher application but also it would be nice to be able to see no idea other than by going to the", " application to Matchbox I don't know where to find a list of thing that are configured to launch on login but not using login time so that is let's say in the transitional. And I hope they approve it and finally and this is either going to take 3 second or another hour Nicholas Gaffney right you have to use one of your co-host mean work machine for a week with minimal change to preference apps Etc who do you choose bonus which host would you trust more to use your main Mac for a week I will start I will get everyone angry at me first I I think I would want to use Marcos iMac Pro because I and I think it's going to be most similar to my own set up now I saw John on mute so I have a feeling he's about to argue with me I'm too scared if you set up the John like look at why do you have a second dock in the corner you scream there's no need for that you don't need that John you don't need it to the screen so big it'll be in your peripheral vision", " so yeah that's all it is most likely cuz I been a long time but I've seen Marcos computer not seen him use it very very briefly in it looked like a reasonably vanilla Macos installation so to the point that I feel like I could work with it where is I think Joe on which is probably customizing his setup Neo to the end of the Earth and back and then it scare me and more important than anything else I think John said John would be a lot le forgiving to me changing anyting on his computer way to say Marco would be excellent about this but I think Marco you would be forgiving about me changing thing if necessary but I trust most use my name back for a week I am actually going to continue to pick on John and say I would trust Marco because I think John would would not be able to comply with himself but that's the thing John would not be able to control text when I wa a kid all right if that's the case if that's the if that's the deal with and then I'll switch my answer to", " John but in general I'm too scared that and I think Marco know exactly I'm coming from I'm too scared that you would fix it for the definition of now we're right now I'm running front center and switch glass and I've got all sort of thing I've got / least I would fix her so I would change if we're allowed to change the scroll Direction give me the correct direction which is there anyway that is my answer all right Marco it's your turn to get picked on what would you do if I wa basically going to say you for both of u that same reason people using my computer using your computer for the exact same reason I do I do run a fairly vanilla set up and I think John run a much more customizable than either of u and so both I both want myself to be altered a a possible if John wa using my computer I think he would have a lot more complaint and a a result in his job in my computer and and and secondly I wouldn't want to use his because I'd be afraid of messing it up", " yep yes you're not using that person's account like you have it you have your own account know I took it a you obviously we would never want to share password whatever but in this hypothetical scenario I am sitting down on the Marco user on Marcos computer or the John user on John's computer whatever the case may be and so I am literally using your setup I guess I guess I'll just now it come up a your Apple ID setting need to be updated and it will leave system preference and we'll go to the gym into your Mac password we wait a little bit then it go away yeah I have had that happen for sure but it doesn't happen if it's frequently a it sound like yours doe on iCloud and you know what the hell that thing is please tell u because I do it every you know few week and everytime I do what I'm like what are you doing I haven't changed anything related to I don't know what your problem before I mean ok enter my Apple ID password and then you'll go away but I don't know why you were", " ever here and it make me think it's Urban related cuz I think like on Catalina first came out it wa a day where everyone wa getting prompted for it like a hundred time a day like you do it and then we come back 5 minute later right beside think of this not client I go anyway so if you know what that is definitively and can tell u and you know a an extra credit can tell u if there's anything we can do about stopping at although I assume there isn't because Homosassa Riverside thing please tell u a John so who's who's getting in trouble what's going on with Martin install the trackpad is stuttering and you can't record podcast I would like Anna and I wa just so I'd have to say I don't customize my computer if I look it up right now I've got my two apps twitterrific in the stupid Skype thing that I can't get rid of and then I have a time machine Wi-Fi like sound and then the beside car system extension other than what type of Mater a my auto-complete something else that's it I customize new folder", " to command and in the finder because I'm the same person and I have a proper scroll Direction you and Marcus computer briefly I would really just like his Mouse but I can you do and I'm bored I can't type that I have some confidence that they would stay up and be reliable during the time that I wa forced to use it so mean to me yet in the last 2 hour 10 minute and 24 second problem that problem I just can't believe neither one of you think this thing because it is a champion because of you using your computer John is that I might get used to the six-k and I don't want it to happen like I just becomes normal so fast when I go to my computer screen look smaller it's so depressing how instantly 42in at this distance would that be outside more in peripheral vision talk to you next week now this show is over they didn't even mean to begin cuz it wa accidental poet wa accidental John didn't do any research Marco and Casey wouldn't let him cuz it wa accidental or it wa accidental today's TV. FM and", " if you can follow them at the best Casey Liss m a r a c so in the last 24 or 48 hour there ha been a discovery may be an announcement about a new BMW logo now it is not clear to me maybe it's there. Others that it is this just for their new I4 which is like the new electric car or is this going to be embraced across the line I'm not sure if you look at the image with a link in the show note if you look at the image a presented next to the current logo it look like garbage but I seem to be the minority I think pretty much everyone hate it but it's pretty good I like it a lot more than I like the flattened Volkswagen logo it's just doe not look right to me John how do you feel about this so is Fresno I think it is official everywhere if you go to the actual BMW page and here's the good the good is the BMW logo ha not changed much over the year and they change the detail of like are there little ring around the", " Rings and what color are the letter and how dark blue are the little thing on the inside but it hasn't changed that much the new one cycle the same shape letter BMW the propeller the outer ring that say BMW especially not transparent transparency whatever the background is show through but when you see it in their little local thing it show it next to a bunch of other logo for the ring used to be black with white letter and I think that look bad super bad cuz it's still the same logo it's not like they stylized in made it all 90's animated drop Shadows or whatever it's fairly straightforward but it's weaker it ha lower contrast it have le personality and it look somewhat incomplete when you see it on the car in the body color she go through it can kind of look cool and depending on the body color now suddenly the body color you choose for your car influence have the logo look in context on the car thing still think it look mostly okay specially like you to the new eye logo they have a new logo for the eye car in", " it it's a nice matchup for that it's all very 2D and flat like if you look at the last lower than 97 it's filled with 3D shading and also ask you more detail but they don't know what they're worth seeing more of experience but it look like iOS 6 let's put it that way. Logo look like iOS 6 and the new logo doesn't look like iOS 7 but it's closer everything is flat there is no shading everything is solid color I'm not sold on the transparency yeah they like you mentioned how I like the deed this logo Trina progress image here showing against a gray background it doesn't look good against Gray you know what's a really common color for car so true Shades of Grey but one thing to look white right like 8 and I think it's going to I think it ha a pretty good chance of looking good on black because that will most of most closely approximates the way it looked forever but it'll be weird though because the black will be sunken cuz that'll be like body metal like yeah like I think it'll look okay on black and", " very dark color I might look okay on straight white but it won't probably won't look good on any silver or medium gray book they sell a lot of I don't know I just I see this and I think this is an interesting idea but this isn't how I would have done it and I don't think it work I don't think it's successful I I don't think it look good the good news is that when you see it on the I-4 the rest of the I-4 is so he is looking that you immediately forget about the love of God that's all right it's better than the grill is truly and utterly terrible like the grill it's not quite Lexus bad but it is right on the edge of a really awful grill that are usually awful BMW concept car treatment of the kidney Grille this one is middle of the road or the actual physical on the frontier people watched don't want to put a big game called and they plug it like the first Tesla Model S with this big black thing but we don't need to put a plug in it figured that out", " at least really quickly and said we're not going to do that they like their signature is the the front grill or they wanted to be in the front grill like Lexus their new design trend of having these massive mesh thing in the front Genesis with a similar Style with a trying to Define their Style by his massive gaping Grill this is when you go electric is going to be pointless don't make that your brand identity you know I'm watching this is now on the BMW concept I-4 page there's a 30 second video I didn't realize that ridiculously huge Grill there's it say I-4 with in it which is or what would ever find it light up like the god awful terrible Mercedes logo Supply. I know I know but yeah they better not to logo is so bad when it's a look at me my fancy ask Mercedes aren't I cool a different treatment with the three-pointed star but don't one day so you know what we're making the star fat or whatever like it's more or le than three three prong logo it would look like the BMW thing is like over the year", " of Marla stay the same but if you look in any individual Mercedes a wide variation and how they treat that logo I feel like BMW had the same advantage and that they had lot of APA you know their logo wa a little circle there wa basically a neutral-colored black circle with letter BMW and a slight accent to Blue in the middle of spine and everything and it look good like it wa not broken it need to be fixed it say BMW concept by for it is lit up in the I hope not but the illuminated illuminated Mercedes logo make me so angry that are not for sure which silly but I really thought there angel eye were amazing so if you're not familiar maybe late 90 or something like that exactly when but BMW headlight they were all there for a long time or four circle and what they did is they have a ring around the outside of each of the headlight that would light up and that wa their daytime running light they called them angel eye and they were to my recollection anyway the first manufacturer to do a treatment of there", " Piggly daytime running light that wa a signature thing right so you saw those four circle coming at you you knew that that wa a BMW and it wa within 5 or 10 year that they play every other auto manufacturer in the world started doing the same thing but they seem to have given up on the four circle and I suppose that probably make sense from technological point of view but to me I actually almost feel like especially in the age of electric car coming back to what you were saying Jon Hamm the kidney Grille like yes I know that's blasphemous but can the kidney Grill and keep the angel eye but now they've got light that don't want you to somewhere for my my golf how do I still do the first of the four light like that still their signature before life thing like they change the logo and yet they kept this giant kidney grill that is totally unnecessary in the car by the way it ha an air intake it's below the kidney grill that it's like they're like in that little slot like that's there is an air intake there but", " the grill isn't it which is even more ridiculous that they have this ridiculous Tylenol near Lake I think it's something that's been long-standing I kind of dropped the kidney grill for electric car that don't need her drop the kit the defining styling element of the entire brand you cannot drop that you can make it you can decide to minimize it instead of maximizing instead of it every model make it bigger instead of smaller that's what I wa getting at before but I don't think you need to drop it especially at various time if you look at the 850 you can make the kidney are really small small that's what you meant like it's not a problem for like you can't use the kidney if you have electric car I wa saying is if you know you're not going to be there until it's perfectly fine to keep the kidney just you know find a way to make them look nice cuz now that's all they have to do is look nice but if it look nice and not add too much drag I like actually like the headlight for concept they're not there like a", " ship a is but it's really nice aggressive-looking had liked it still look like BMW to me if I could have a smaller Kitty I like the way the front of the car look much le now that's big news Gorillaz just so bad"]
